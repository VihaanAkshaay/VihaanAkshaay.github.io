In hindsight, I wish I had not booked the aisle seat. Maybe because there is nothing but the to see 

Hakodate - Calm (Warm, write about the lady I met at the park) and lonely 
Tokyo - Busy (Is that what makes it cold? Is it the people or the place?)
Transition is similar to how I'm going from a trip to a year filled with repsponsibilities, dreams, passions and people.

 Days have been long, despite being short. The world screams out for more, but I don't feel the same. The sun sets on its own, we'll be okay.  That's how we know. That's all we know.

## Retrospect

### Comfort

Self.
One's self is nothing but their past. Being one's self is comfort. Momentary comfort, just that.

Familiarity. 
Personal preferences I wish to find some comfort in the panic.

## Introspect

I can't see the finish line. The fear finds a way.

### Gratitude

### Delusion

Constantly clocking a million minutes on music
 is nothing but a constant attempt to 

## Extrospect



## Allospect



### Expression

Tear up this town.

## Prospect

This  old lady next to me on the window seatsees me getting curious about something, while looking at the monitor in front of me from the cockpit view, and puts up the blinds of the airplane window. Although it was bright and blinding, being someone who loves the dark, I was annoyed at an instant.  my 'self' was quick to judge, but its time to close the laptop and enjoy Mt.Fuji the cute lady was showing me.

Sitting beside me, the elderly woman in the window seat noticed my curiosity piqued by the cockpit's monitor view. Without a word, she lifted the airplane window blind. The sudden brightness was almost blinding, a stark contrast to the darkness I usually prefer, sparking a flicker of annoyance within me. However, my initial self-centered judgment quickly dissolved as I realized she was kindly pointing out the majestic view of Mt. Fuji. In that moment, I decided to shut my laptop, embracing the breathtaking scene she shared. Unanticipatedly, the aisle seat bestowed upon me an unexpected blessing.

Although it was blinding, 
Maybe the aisle seat is a blessing I did not foresee.
