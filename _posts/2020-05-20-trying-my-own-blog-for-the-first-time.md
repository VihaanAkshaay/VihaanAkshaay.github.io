##### Robots are everywhere! 
Ranging from robots in movies like Noist Boy from Real Steel <br />
'You pass the butter' from rick and morty <br />
And my all time favorite 'Wall-E' <br />
......[enter more examples].....  

Have these made you want to build your own robots? Could be a swarm of nanobots or something insane like the Ultron! That's upto you, but the first hurdle usually is 'How do I start building robots?' (see what I did there :p) If you're stuck with this problem, then you're exactly the person I'm writing this post for! 

Now before we get readied with how to build a simple robot, let's first know what a [robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot) is.
To be very honest, from the resources I've been exposed to, I've not come across a satisfactory definition of a robot. But yes, eventually I've settled with a conglomeration of various definitions. A very conjectural take on a robot would be to call it a machine that performs a particular kind of task. To describe the task a little better, it can be broken down into three sub-parts.

Let's go over an example to understand how this division works. Imagine you're asked to pick up a certain object in front of you. A quick breakdown of how you would perform the above task would be <br/>
 - You will look at the surroundings and locate the object of interest. (*perception*)
- You would decide on how you're going to move your body, hands in specific to reach the object without colliding with obstacles in the scene (*decision making*)
- Now you'd perform the action by moving your hands, grasping the object and taking it to the goal position.(*action!)*
